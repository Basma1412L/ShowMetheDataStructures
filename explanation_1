I used OrderedDict to keep track of the order while inserting to the dict.
For the get method I get the value of the element then reinsert it to increase its position in the dictionary.
For the set if the capacity is full, then the last element will be removed.

Complexity of set function is o(1)
Complexity of get function is o(1)
space complexity is o(n) where n is the capacity
