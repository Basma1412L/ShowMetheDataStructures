I used recursion to solve this problem
the function will check if  the path is none then it will stop
else it will check if it is a directory or a file
if a directory it will call the function on all the children
else if it is a file it will append the file to the other files and return it

The complexity of find_files  is o(n) where n is the number of dictionaries and paths and dictioniaries inside each one
array of the paths size is required to save the paths
